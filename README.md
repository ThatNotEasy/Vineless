* Works by redirecting the content keys to the browser's ClearKey handler

## Features
+ User-friendly / GUI-based
+ Supports Widevine and PlayReady-protected content

## Devices
* This addon requires a Widevine/PlayReady Device file to work. Don't ask me where to get those.

## Compatibility
+ Compatible (tested) browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Marble, and Supermium on Windows
+ Works with any service that accepts challenges from Android devices on the same endpoint.

## Setup
+ Open the extension and click one of the `Choose File` buttons to select device files
+ Select the type of device you're using in the top `Systems` section
+ The files are saved in the extension's `chrome.storage.sync` storage and will be synchronized across any browsers into which the user is signed in with their Google account.
+ The maximum number of devices is ~25 Local **OR** ~200 Remote CDMs
+ Check `Enabled` to activate the message interception and you're done.

## Usage
All the user has to do is to play a DRM protected video. With everything set up properly, videos will start to play even without a supported DRM system.

## FAQ
> What if I'm unable to play the video?

This automatically means that the license server is blocking your CDM and that you either need a CDM from a physical device, a ChromeCDM, or an L1 Android CDM. Don't ask where you can get these
